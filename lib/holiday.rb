# Note: What follows are extra methods not required for this assignment.
# In the "Procedural Ruby Discussion, Part 2", we learned how to combine the functionalities of #add_supply_to_memorial_day and #add_supply_to_winter_holidays into one method:

def add_supply_to_holidays(holiday_hash, supply)
  holiday_hash.each do |season, holidays|
    holidays.each do |holiday, supplies| 
      supplies << supply 
    end 
  end 
end

# However, that only adds the supply to EVERY holiday! 
# To add a supply to a SPECIFIC holiday and/or add a new holiday and/or season, do this:

def add_supply_to_holiday(holiday_hash, season, holiday, supply)
  holiday_hash[season][holiday] << supply
end

# Finally, to add a new season to the holiday_hash:

def add_new_season_with_holidays_and_supplies(holiday_hash, season, holidays)
  holiday_hash[season] = holidays 
end
